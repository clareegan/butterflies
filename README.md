### *Project by Clare Egan*

Monarch Butterfly migration has been happening all around you, likely without you even noticing! Their migration is a fascinating natural event where millions of Monarchs go on an incredible journey of up to 3,000 miles! Typically starting in the United States and Canada, Monarchs head to the pine-covered mountains of central Mexico. This awesome annual trip involves different generations of monarchs, dealing with challenges like weather and obstacles to reach their wintering spot, making it a remarkable display that grabs the attention of scientists and nature fans alike.

## About this project
This project idea came to me after attending the Louisville Zoo's "Monarchs and Mimosas" lecture on Monarch Migration, what plants attract the butterflies and what is necessary to create a pollinator garden.


## Running the program
1. Python 3 is required. This project is written using version 3.12.0.  Make sure you have installed that version of Python from their website [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/python-3.12.0-macos11.pkg)
2. Clone the repo from github, use this code
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/clareegan/butterflies.git
   ```
3. Set up your working directory.
   ```
    https://github.com/clareegan/butterflies.git
   ```
4. Set up a virtual environment.


    On Windows:

      ```
    python -m venv venv
    ```


      On macOS and Linux:

   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
5. Activate the virtual environment

    On Windows:

   ```
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS and Linux:

   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
     
6.  To make sure you have all the necessary packages, run
    ```
    "pip install -r requirements.txt".
      ```


The following packages will be required to run the program:
pandas,
numpy,
matplotlib.pyplot,
scipy,
seaborn </br> 

To run the "main.ipynb" file, Jupyter Notebook needs to be installed. 

The program can be run directly by running "main.py" from the script folder. You can also run the "main.ipynb" file from script folder using Jupyter Notebook.
