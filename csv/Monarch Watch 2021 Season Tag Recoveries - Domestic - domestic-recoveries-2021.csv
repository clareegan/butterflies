David passed away last May, after a long cancer battle, but his many young students will always remember him as the 'Butterfly Man' and his dedication to teaching them about the importance of the environment and their roles in the natural world. I believe this butterfly was one of many released at the school's annual Butterfly release (which David began so many years ago), which occurred 4 days before the picture was made.
